    /// \detailed Contains a VertexData, a set of uniform collections, a shader, animations, a skeleton.
    ///
    /// \warning I think this class contains a bit too much implementation. (see draw method). It seems weird that "Model"
    /// is responsible for binding and clearing all uniform data for the shader.
    ///
    /// \todo the shaderprogram and uniform data (textures etc.)  Should probably
    /// be broken out into a new abstraction. This work would be a good match for the "material" class seen in many engines.
    ///
    /// \todo I want to limit access to the draw function to be used by camera only... conceptually, a model can only be seen ("drawn") by a camera. but this will introduce a friend, prevent reuse of Model outside of this Graphics project, break encaps, make
    /// Model harder to read (because now you must also read Camera), just bad things.
    /// 1) Is that a bad thing? yes 2) Is hiding draw(...) from the enduser overkill? depends on use-case 3) Conclusions: another way to accomplish this (hiding from user, showing to camera) would be via interfaces. Perhaps camera draw takes a 
    /// collection of drawables, not models.
    /// then for the end-user, perhaps it should be up to the direct user of this project to decide whether or not to hide draw from them, and to accomplish that via their own model interface that stands between user and an instance of this.
    /// so the accessability of model::draw will be the responsibility to the direc tuser of this project (passing the buck because use cases vary). and tangentally, camera should possibly take a pointer via interface to "drawable"... possibly
    /// model will have siblings in the future (?)
    /// 4) perhaps there should be a new layer of abstraction? Model, Texture, e.g as they currently exist should be renamed GLModel, GLTexture e.g since they are so tied to the GL, have a set of interfaces, logical Texture, Model etc. where the bare minimum
